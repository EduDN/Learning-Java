## Maven
- Maven use to manage dependencies to Java our projects

## Frameworks for Java
- Spring Boot - Simplifies the process of creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications
- Hibernate - Simplifies data handling by automating mapping objects to database tables

## Application Servers
Provide environments for deploying and managing Java applications
- Apache Tomcat - Ideal for small to medium-sized applications
- JBoss - Ideal for large enterprise applications

## Uses
- Web Applications
- Mobile Applications (Kotlin is preferred for Android)
- Desktop Applications (JavaFX)
- Embedded Systems (Java ME)
- Web Servers

## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- Converts Java bytecode into machine code
- Manage memory, garbage collection

## Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- PROVIDES libraries, Java Virtual Machine, and other components to run applications written in Java
- Includes Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
-
## Java Development Kit (JDK)
- PROVIDES tools for developing Java applications
- Includes JRE

## Glossary Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Object - Uses for modeling real-world objects
- Class - We can define properties and actions for objects
- Method - Actions that can be performed by objects
- Inheritance - Allow share features between classes
- Polymorphism - Action to Adapts to objects
- Encapsulation - Hide details of an object and prevents unauthorized access
